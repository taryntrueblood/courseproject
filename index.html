            <p>Tigers are very interesting creatures that everyone loves and needs protecting.</p>
            <p>Tigers are the largest felines in the world and as such, many cultures consider the tiger to be a symbol
                of strength, courage and dignity. The tiger is one of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals, and those born
                in the "Year of the Tiger" are thought to be brave, competitive and self-confident.</p>
                <p>However, because hunting them is also a sign of bravery in some cultures, tigers are endangered. Tigers
                are hunted for their meat, pelt and body parts that are used in folk remedies. To make matters worse,
                these great cats have lost most of their habitat due to logging, road building and development,
                according to All About Wildlife. Experts estimate there are no more than 3,200 tigers left in the wild.

                            <li>Tigers are the largest cat species in the world and the third-largest carnivore on land--only polar and brown bears are
                            larger.</li>
                            <li>An adult Amur or Siberian tiger (the largest subspecies) can weigh up to 660 pounds.</li>
                            <li>The average lifespan of a wild tiger is 10 - 15 years. But on rare occasion, they have been known to live up to 26 years
                            in the wild.</li>
                            <li>Tigers are generally nocturnal hunters. Their night vision is up to six-times greater than ours. But they're also
                            opportunists, which means they won't pass up the chance for a daytime snack when it's available.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Tigers are ambush hunters preferring to sneak up on their prey before exploding into action, killing them with a bite to
                            the neck or back of the head. They mainly hunt deer, wild boar, buffalo and antelope. But they'll kill and eat what's
                            available, from small birds to bears to the occasional elephant.</li>
                            <li>White spots on the backs of their ears are sometimes thought to function as "eyes" to ward off potential attackers from
                            the rear. Another theory is that they help tiger cubs follow their mothers through tall grass.</li>
                            <li>White tigers are not a separate subspecies nor are they albino. They are leucistic, the result of a recessive gene from
                            each parent that affects pigmentation. White tigers typically have blue eyes.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Just over a century ago, there were as many as 100,000 wild tigers living in Asia. Today, fewer than 3,900 remain.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The tiger is classified into nine subspecies, three of which (Javan, Caspian, and Bali) are extinct. A fourth, the
                                South-China subspecies, is most likely extinct in the wild, with no signs of its existence in the last decade. The existing subspecies are Bengal, Indochinese, Sumatran, Siberian, and Malayan.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Tigers are globally listed as “Endangered” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of
                                Threatened Species. The Malayan and Sumatran sub-species are listed as “Critically Endangered.”
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                       <h4>Main threats</h4>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Wild tigers are hunted to meet the demands of the $20 billion a year illegal wildlife market. Tiger parts are consumed
                        for traditional medicinal purposes across Asia, with a heavy demand in China.</li>

                        <li>Wild tigers are persecuted when villagers take retaliatory measures to protect their livestock and communities.</li>
                        <li>Tiger habitat is increasingly under threat from agricultural developments, especially monocultures like palm oil
                        plantations.</li>

                        <li>Tiger prey, like deer and wild pigs, continue to be overhunted, forcing tigers to attack livestock to feed themselves
                        and their cubs, thus fueling human-tiger conflict.
                        </li>
